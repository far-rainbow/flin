===============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaysalvat/pin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaysalvat/pin)
[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/pin.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/pin)

Pin is a tiny Javascript library with some jQuery features:
DOM traversing, DOM manipulation, namespaced Events and plugin architecture.

Unit tests are green on IE9+, Chrome 30+, Firefox 30+, Opera 20+, Safari 5+ 
that should makes it a great choice for most modern apps, mobile or not.

The minified library weighs ~5.5kb, ~2kb GZIPed.
An even lighter alternative (~1.5kb, ~700 bytes GZIPed) is available with only
selectors and plugin architecture to let you build your own perfect library.

**Important Note:** Even if the Pin API is near jQuery API, its goals is ABSOLUTELY NOT
to be compatible at all.
If you need jQuery compatibily with a lighter lib, choose [http://zeptojs.com/](Zepto).
